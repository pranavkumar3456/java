Size:

- Array: Fixed size, determined at creation.
- ArrayList: Dynamic size, can grow or shrink as needed.



Type:

- Array: Can hold primitive types and objects.
- ArrayList: Can only hold objects (uses wrapper classes for primitives).



Performance:

- Array: Generally faster for simple operations due to direct memory access.
- ArrayList: Slightly slower but offers more flexibility.

Functionality:

- Array: Basic, limited to indexing and iteration.
- ArrayList: Rich set of methods for manipulation (add, remove, etc.).

Type Safety:

- Array: Checked at compile-time and runtime.
- ArrayList: Only checked at runtime when using generics.
