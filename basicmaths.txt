1) Sum of first N natural Number  = (N(N+1))/2
2) Geometric Progression = Ratio of any 2 consecutive term is constant/same.

     Series1: 2 6 18 54 162
     Here Ratio between 2 and 6 is 1/3 same 6 and 18 is 1/3, 18 and 54 is 1/3 and 54 and 162 is also 1/3. So we can tell that these are in Geometric Progression.

     
    Sum of first N terms in Geometric Progression: 
    
    a * (r^N -1)/(r-1)
    
    a= first term
    r= common ratio 
    N = No of element.

  eg: 2 6 18 54 162
     2*(((1/3)^5-1)*(5-1)
    = âˆ’7.97 --> i.e., -8
3) Elements in range [a,b] ==> a is included but b is not 
    ==> b-a
4) Elements in range [a,b] ==> a and b both are excluded
    ==> b-a-1
5) Elements in range [a,b] ==> a and b both are incuded
   ==> b-a+1

6) Arthmetic Progression: --> Difference between any two consecutive number is same.

   1 2 3 4 5 6 
   here difference between two consecutive number is same so we can tell that these are in arthemetic progression.

a = First Term
d = common difference
n = no of terms

Sn = (n/2)[2a+(n-1)d]

eg: --> 
1 4 7 10 13 16
sum of first 6 terms in AP

here n = 6
d = 3
a = 1
so Sn = 51


Permutation:

Find a ways to arrange a r character from given n distinct character.

nPr --> n!/(n-r)!
